# Movie Collection Api
---

## Planning Story
First the Wireframe and the ERD, to get a better understanding to what the goal of my app was. Following the ERD layout the database in mongoDB was built using mongoose and express to 'structure' how the data would be received and stored. First the Schemas of the data which will be received and stored were made to make sure the data flowed both ways well. Then proceeded to make the routes to meet all the CRUD request for adding, updating, reading, and deleting a document from the collection. Afterward, began building the front end and used curl-scripts to make sure the front end was communicating with the API.
